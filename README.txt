Android Application Build Script Extension

This project provides scripts that extends build script (build.xml)
generated by Android SDK Tools.

Features :

    * Add target for static code analyzing.

        * FindBugs (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)

    * Add targets for tests.

        * Generate test result by XML format.
        * Generate coverage report by XML format.

Required softwares :

    * Android SDK Tools Revision 14 or higher (http://developer.android.com/)
    * Ant 1.8.0 or higher (http://ant.apache.org/)
    * Jython 2.5.x (http://www.jython.org/)

First Setup :

    1. Locate this directory that names "build" at top directory of application
       project.

    2. Copy the below and paste to the below of <import> task at build.xml.

        <import file="build/extended_build.xml" />

    3. Replace the value of version-tag to "custom" at build.xml.

FindBugs Setup :

    1. Install FindBugs to externals/findbugs or other directory.

    2. Locate findbugs-ant.jar to one of library directory of Ant.

    3. Turn true findbugs.enable in config/extension.properties.

    4. Modify findbugs.home to directory installed FindBugs if you need.

Test Setup :

    1. Copy the below and paste to the below of <import> task at build.xml in the
       test project.

        <import file="${tested.project.dir}/build/extended_build.xml" />

    2. Replace the value of version-tag to "custom" at build.xml.

    3. Turn true test.enable in config/extension.properties.

Added Targets :

    After "FindBugs Setup" :

        findbugs : Run FindBugs and report as HTML.

        findbugs-xml : Run FindBugs and report as XML.

        Example :

            ant findbugs
                Run FindBugs and report as HTML on project executing Ant.

            NOTICE : If you located findbugs-ant.jar to other directory,
                     you must specify path of it by -lib option of Ant.

    After "Test Setup" :

        These targets must be ran on test project.

        test-xml : Run tests and generate report by XML.

        Example :

            ant test-xml
                Run tests and generate XML of test result.
                The tested and test application must be installed before
                this target is ran.

            ant debug install test-xml
                Build test and tested application, install the both application,
                run tests and generate XML of test result.

            ant emma debug install test-xml
                Build test and tested application, install the both application,
                run tests and generate XML of test result and HTML / XML of
                coverage reports.
