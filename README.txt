Android Application Build Script Extension

This project provides scripts that extends build script (build.xml)
generated by Android SDK Tools.

Features :

    * Add target for static code analyzing.

        * Checkstyle (http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/)
        * FindBugs (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)
        * JavaNCSS (http://www.kclee.de/clemens/java/javancss/)
        * PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/)
        * PMD's Copy/Paste Detector (CPD) (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html)

    * Add targets for tests.

        * Generate test result by XML format.
        * Generate coverage report by XML format.

Required softwares :

    * Android SDK Tools Revision 17 or higher (http://developer.android.com/)
    * Ant 1.8.0 or higher (http://ant.apache.org/)
    * Jython 2.5.x (http://www.jython.org/) for targets of test.
    * Static code analyzer package for targets for static code analyze.

Removed feature from sdk_r16 :

    * Coverage filtering
        * Because Android SDK Tools supports coverage filter from revision 17.
          You can filter coverage result by "coverage.filter" property.

First Setup :
