Android Application Build Script Extension

This project provides a set of script that extends build script (build.xml)
generated by Android SDK.

Features :

    * Add target for static code analyzing.

        * FindBugs (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)

    * Add targets for tests.

        * Generate test result by XML format.
        * Generate coverage report by XML format.

Required softwares :

    * Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/)
    * Ant 1.8.0 or higher (http://ant.apache.org/)
    * Python 2.7.x (http://python.org/)
    * Jython 2.5.x (http://www.jython.org/)

First Setup :

    1. Locate this directory that names "build" at top directory of application
       project.
    2. Copy or make symbolic link from build-start-scripts/start-build.py to
       top directory of application project.
    3. Copy the below and paste to the below of <setup /> at build.xml.

            <if condition="${extended.build}">
                <then>
                    <import file="build/extended_build.xml" />
                </then>
            </if>

FindBugs Setup :

    1. Install FindBugs to externals/findbugs or other directory.
    2. Locate findbugs-ant.jar to externals/lib or library directory of Ant.
    3. Turn true findbugs.enable in config/extension.properties.
    4. Modify findbugs.home to directory installed FindBugs if you need.

Test Setup :

    1. Copy the below and paste to the below of <setup /> at build.xml in the
       test project.

            <if condition="${extended.build}">
                <then>
                    <import file="${tested.project.dir}/build/extended_test_build.xml" />
                </then>
            </if>

    2. Turn true test.enable in config/extension.properties.

Script Running :

    * Execute the below command at top directory of application.
      Replace "<target>" to name of target that you want to run.

        ./start-build.py <target>

    * Execute the below command to see help.

        ./start-build.py --help

Added Targets :

    After "FindBugs Setup" :

        findbugs : Run FindBugs.

    After "Test Setup" :

        coverage-reports : Run tests and generate test report by XML and
                           coverage report by XML and HTML.

        run-tests-xml : Run tests and generate test report by XML.

        run-tests-and-judge : Run tests and judge whether the test succeeded.
                              If the test is failed, the build will fail.

    Run for detail :

        ./start-build.py --help
